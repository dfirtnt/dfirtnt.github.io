<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Threat reports are everywhere—but most don't help you hunt. Fancy graphics and vague analysis rarely translate into detection logic. You end up scrolling 20 pages, searching for gritty details: command lines, DNS patterns, parent-child process chains.</p>

<p>That's why I built <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67dc5ef37aec8191a254c4802ee110b0-huntable-tactical-threat-intelligence-assistant"><strong>Huntable GPT</strong></a>—a small, purpose-built AI assistant that reads threat reports like a practitioner and pulls out what blue-team defenders actually care about.</p>
