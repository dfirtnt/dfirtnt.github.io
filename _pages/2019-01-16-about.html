<p>"DFIR TNT" means Digital Forensics and Incident Response Tips-n-Tricks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I am Andrew Skatoff.<br>I have been securing and protecting critical infrastructure networks since 2002.<br><br>Raised by a Topgun Marine fighter pilot and a middle school special ed  teacher, I was always driven to find meaningful work, solve interesting problems and help others do the same in an effort to make the world a  better and safer place.<br><br>My love for computers started in college and after spending several years providing tech support in the energy and financial sectors, I achieved my MCSE certification. This led to my first info security job supporting a migration to active directory.  I then went onto champion, design and implement an automated compliance and vulnerability management program. <br><br>I have been developing and leading incident response, malware analysis, threat hunting and digital forensics services for the past 18 years in critical infrastructure financial organizations. <br><br>I currently hold GREM, GCFA, GDAT, GNFA and CISSP certifications and serve as an Incident Response Senior Manager at a large financial organization. </p>
