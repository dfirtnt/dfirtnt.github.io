<p>This blog exists to collect the thoughts, discoveries, and experiences I have as a digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) enthusiast. The "tips and tricks" compiled here are as much for me as they are for you. I am happy you're here and I hope we can help each other! Blue Team Forever!</p>
